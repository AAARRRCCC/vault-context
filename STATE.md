- **Blockers:** None

## Decision Log

| Time | Decision | Reasoning |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 20:53 | Executed PLAN-001 as part of WO-010 | WO-010 required manual execution of test plan |
| 20:57 | Moved Welcome.md → 04_Archive | File itself instructed archiving once comfortable |
| 20:57 | Tagged README.md #needs-processing | Ambiguous destination — inbox's own documentation |
| 21:00 | Running PLAN-002 to validate autonomous loop | WO-011 requires end-to-end test with PLAN-002 |
| 21:01 | Data-Science-ML.md type=resource | Located in 03_Resources/, clearly reference material |
| 21:01 | Welcome.md type=note status=archived | Archived onboarding doc, not an ongoing resource |
| 22:16 | Used jq over python3 for JSON escaping in mayor-signal.sh | jq is cleaner and available at /usr/bin/jq (v1.7.1) |
| 22:33 | Chose stdin JSON (Option C) for mayor-signal.sh refactor | No arg escaping issues; jq heredoc is readable and handles all special chars cleanly |
| 22:55 | Implemented quiet hours with TZ="America/New_York" date +%H | Simple, available natively in bash; used 10# prefix to avoid octal parsing bugs |
