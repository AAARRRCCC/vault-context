# Mac Mini Setup — Verification Report

**Verified by:** Claude Code (Sonnet 4.6)
**Date:** 2026-02-19

---

## Hardware & OS

- ✅ **Mac Mini (Apple Silicon)** — Apple M4
- ✅ **macOS** — 15.5 (Build 24F74)

## Core Software Stack

- ✅ **Claude Code** — v2.1.70
- ✅ **Obsidian** — v1.12.2 (installer 1.11.7), vault `knowledge-base` confirmed
- ✅ **Obsidian CLI** — v1.12.2 (ships with Obsidian)
- ✅ **Node.js / pnpm** — Node v25.6.1, pnpm v9.15.4
- ✅ **gallery-dl** — Python tool for downloading Twitter content + metadata (installed via brew)
- ✅ **Git remote** — `https://github.com/AAARRRCCC/knowledge-base.git`
  - Note: checklist said `vault-context` but that is the public mirror — the vault's own remote is correctly `knowledge-base`

## Vault Structure

- ⚠️ **Root follows claudesidian template** — PARA folders all present, but root has extra noise: `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `install.sh`, `LICENSE`, `node_modules/`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `Untitled.canvas`, `Untitled 1.canvas`. These are claudesidian scaffolding leftovers.
- ✅ **Folder structure** — all seven present: `00_Inbox/` through `06_Metadata/`
- ✅ **`CLAUDE.md`** at vault root
- ✅ **`.claude/` directory** — `commands/`, `hooks/`, `mcp-servers/`, `skills/` all present

## Claude Code Configuration

- ✅ **`settings.json` and `settings.local.json`** — both present
- ✅ **`vault-config.json`** — present
- ✅ **Skills** — all 8 installed: defuddle, git-worktrees, json-canvas, obsidian-bases, obsidian-cli, obsidian-markdown, skill-creator, systematic-debugging
- ✅ **Commands** — all 15 present: add-frontmatter, create-command, daily-review, de-ai-ify, download-attachment, inbox-processor, init-bootstrap, install-claudesidian-command, pragmatic-review, pull-request, release, research-assistant, thinking-partner, upgrade, weekly-synthesis

## MCP Integration

- ✅ **basic-memory** — v0.18.4, project `main` pointing to vault, 41 entities indexed
- ✅ **Gemini Vision MCP server** — present in `.claude/mcp-servers/`
- ⚠️ **basic-memory note modification** — `format_on_save: false` ✅, but `disable_permalinks: false` means it injected `permalink:` frontmatter into existing notes during initial `reset --reindex`. Now accepted behavior. To prevent entirely: set `disable_permalinks: true` in `~/.basic-memory/config.json`.

## Scripts

- ✅ All 7 present in `.scripts/`: `firecrawl-batch.sh`, `firecrawl-scrape.sh`, `fix-renamed-links.js`, `sync-context.sh`, `transcript-extract.sh`, `update-attachment-links.js`, `vault-stats.sh`

## Git Workflow

- ✅ Git repo with remote configured
- ✅ `.gitignore` present
- ✅ Session-end auto-commit — `Stop` hook in `.claude/settings.json` commits and pushes on session end
- ✅ Post-commit hook — `.git/hooks/post-commit` runs `sync-context.sh` to update public mirror on every commit

## System Details

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| macOS version | 15.5 |
| Apple Silicon chip | M4 |
| Claude Code version | 2.1.70 |
| Obsidian version | 1.12.2 |
| Obsidian CLI version | 1.12.2 (bundled with Obsidian) |
| basic-memory version | 0.18.4 |
| Cron jobs | None |
| launchd agents | `com.mayor.workorder-check` (heartbeat, 120s), `com.mayor.dashboard` (web UI, port 3847), `com.foreman.bot` (Discord bot, persistent), `com.foreman.tweet-researcher` (tweet research agent, 300s) |
| GitHub PAT | Present in keychain for `AAARRRCCC` |
| Vault remote | `github.com/AAARRRCCC/knowledge-base` (private) |

---

## Open Items

- Root-level scaffolding files (`CHANGELOG.md`, `install.sh`, `node_modules/`, etc.) are claudesidian template leftovers. Could be cleaned up or left as-is.
- `disable_permalinks` is `false` — basic-memory will add `permalink:` frontmatter to any note it indexes. Intentional for now.
- Obsidian Git plugin not yet installed (auto-commit safety net — manual install required via Obsidian settings).

## Mayor Dashboard

**Added:** 2026-02-25 (PLAN-003)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| URL | `http://localhost:3847` |
| Health check | `http://localhost:3847/health` |
| launchd label | `com.mayor.dashboard` |
| Service file | `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mayor.dashboard.plist` |
| Server code | `~/mayor-dashboard/server.js` |
| Frontend | `~/mayor-dashboard/public/index.html` |
| Stdout log | `~/.local/log/mayor-dashboard.log` |
| Stderr log | `~/.local/log/mayor-dashboard-error.log` |
| Log rotation | Server-side check at startup and hourly; rotates at 10MB |
| Port env var | `MAYOR_DASHBOARD_PORT` (default 3847) |

**Layout modes:**
- **Active Plan mode** (active_plan ≠ 'none'): Hero pipeline visualization (64-80px animated nodes, SVG glow filter, shimmer connectors) + Live Session (left, 62%) + Signals (right, 38%) + Work Orders footer
- **Idle mode** (active_plan = 'none'): Last-completed work card + Pending WO list (priority-sorted) + Signals panel + Work Orders footer

**Hero pipeline:** Custom CSS/SVG hybrid — real DOM nodes with inline connectors, `state-done/active/upcoming/paused/error` CSS classes, `filter: url(#node-glow)` SVG blur on active node, `@keyframes pipeline-pulse` (box-shadow ring + scale), shimmer `@keyframes line-shimmer` (background-position) on active connector. Do NOT use DaisyUI steps component — pseudo-element architecture, not scalable.

**Panels (active mode):** Hero Pipeline · Live Session · Signals · Work Orders footer
**Panels (idle mode):** Last Completed card · Pending Work · Signals · Work Orders footer

**Data sources:** STATE.md, plans/, work-orders/, mayor-signals.jsonl, Claude Code JSONL session logs

**To manage:**
```bash
launchctl list com.mayor.dashboard        # check status
launchctl stop com.mayor.dashboard        # stop
launchctl start com.mayor.dashboard       # start
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mayor.dashboard.plist  # disable
mayor-status.sh                           # includes dashboard status
```

## Foreman Discord Bot

**Added:** 2026-02-25 (PLAN-004, Phase 1)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Bot name | Foreman#7084 |
| launchd label | `com.foreman.bot` |
| Service file | `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.foreman.bot.plist` |
| Bot code | `~/foreman-bot/bot.js` |
| Stdout log | `~/.local/log/foreman-bot.log` |
| Stderr log | `~/.local/log/foreman-bot-error.log` |
| Auth | Responds only to `MAYOR_DISCORD_USER_ID` DMs |
| Reconnect | Auto via launchd KeepAlive |

**Commands:**

| Group | Commands |
|-------|---------|
| Status | `!status`, `!queue`, `!uptime`, `!log`, `!signals` |
| Control | `!resume`, `!pause`, `!cancel`, `!confirm`, `!answer <text>` |
| Diagnostics | `!doctor`, `!ratelimit`, `!accounts`, `!switch <id>`, `!alerts [on\|off]`, `!investigate <subsystem>`, `!fix [lockfile\|heartbeat\|dashboard\|bot\|git\|ratelimit]`, `!tail [heartbeat\|dashboard\|bot\|session]` |
| Scheduling | `!schedule <time> <task>`, `!schedules`, `!unschedule <id>`, `!snooze <id> <duration>` |
| Conversation | `!clear`, `!context` |
| Tweet inbox | `!tweet <url>`, `!tweet <url> <note>`, `!tweet refresh`, `!tweet cleanup`, `!inbox`, `!inbox clear` |
| Tweet research | `!research`, `!research run`, `!research <tweet-id>` |
| Tweet library | `!library [<page>]` |
| Tweet synthesis | `!synthesize`, `!synthesize full`, `!synthesize last` |
| Meds | `!meds`, `!meds history`, `!meds skip <type>`, `!meds pause <duration>`, `!meds on\|off`, `!alarm [<time>]` |
| Other | `!ping`, `!help`, `!twitter` (alias for `!tweet`) |

**Conversational relay (PLAN-008 P2):** Non-command messages route to `claude -p` with a Foreman system prompt, STATE.md context, and per-user conversation history (last 10 exchange pairs, 30-minute session timeout). History stored in `~/.local/state/foreman-conversations.json`. Max budget $2.00/relay call, timeout 180s.

**Proactive system alerts (PLAN-008 P3):** `system-monitor.js` runs every 5 minutes, checking disk space (warn 85%, critical 95%), stale lockfile, dead heartbeat, failed/blocked WOs, git divergence, and long idle. Alerts to Brady's DM as embeds (yellow/red). 1-hour cooldown per alert type. Toggle with `!alerts on/off`.

**Task scheduling (PLAN-008 P4):** `scheduler.js` with `chrono-node` for natural language time parsing. Schedule one-off or recurring tasks from Discord. Storage: `~/.local/state/foreman-schedule.json`. Missed tasks skipped if >15 min late. 3 consecutive failures disables + alerts.

**Rate limit detection (PLAN-008 P1):** `mayor-check.sh` detects rate limit output, writes `~/.local/state/rate-limited.json`, sends one Discord alert (no repeated errors). Heartbeat skips Claude invocation while limited. `!ratelimit` shows status; `!fix ratelimit` clears the flag.

**Account failover (PLAN-008 P5):** `~/.local/state/foreman-accounts.json` tracks configured accounts. `!accounts` shows status. `!switch <id>` updates active account + clears rate limit flag. Actual auth switch requires `claude auth login` in terminal (OAuth-only, no automated switching). Rate limit alerts include next-available-account suggestion.

**Audit trail (added PLAN-005):** `!resume`, `!pause`, `!cancel`, `!answer` append a row to STATE.md's Decision Log table with timestamp, action, and "Discord command" reasoning.

**Interactive signals:** `checkpoint` and `blocked` signals include a reply prompt in the embed footer. Context file `~/.local/state/last-signal-context.json` persists signal context for `!resume`/`!answer`.

**Presence:** Updates every 30 seconds. Green/online = processing; yellow/idle = paused; invisible = idle.

**Prompt file:** `~/foreman-bot/foreman-prompt.md`
**Bot modules:** `~/foreman-bot/conversation-store.js`, `~/foreman-bot/system-monitor.js`, `~/foreman-bot/scheduler.js`

**To manage:**
```bash
launchctl list com.foreman.bot                          # check status
launchctl stop com.foreman.bot                         # stop
launchctl start com.foreman.bot                        # start
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.foreman.bot.plist   # disable
tail -f ~/.local/log/foreman-bot.log                   # live log
```

## Tweet Inbox Pipeline

**Added:** 2026-03-01 (PLAN-009)

Brady shares tweet URLs in Foreman DMs; gallery-dl captures full content to vault-context for later Mayor review.

| Component | Path | Role |
|-----------|------|------|
| gallery-dl config | `~/.config/gallery-dl/config.json` | Twitter extractor settings (text-tweets, conversations, expand, quoted) |
| Cookie source | Chrome (via `--cookies-from-browser chrome` CLI flag) | Auth for Twitter API — must be logged in via Chrome on Mac Mini |
| Staging dir | `~/.local/share/tweet-staging/` | Temp download area, cleaned after each capture |
| Capture script | `~/.local/bin/tweet-capture.sh` | Orchestrates gallery-dl → post-process → git commit |
| Post-processor | `~/foreman-bot/tweet-processor.js` | Converts gallery-dl output to clean `content.md` + inbox entry |
| Inbox | `~/Documents/vault-context/inbox/tweets/` | Active pending entries (`TWEET-{id}/`) |
| Archive | `~/Documents/vault-context/inbox/tweets/archive/` | Reviewed entries (moved by `!inbox clear`) |
| Cleanup script | `~/.local/bin/tweet-inbox-cleanup.sh` | Removes images from archive entries >30 days old |

**Foreman commands:**

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `!tweet <url>` | Capture a tweet explicitly |
| `!tweet <url> <note>` | Capture with Brady's note attached |
| `!tweet refresh` | Check if Twitter cookies are still valid |
| `!tweet cleanup` | Remove old images from archive (manual, on demand) |
| `!inbox` | List pending tweets with author + preview |
| `!inbox clear` | Archive all pending items |
| Auto-detect | Any x.com/twitter.com URL in DM triggers capture automatically |

**Inbox entry format:**
Each `TWEET-{id}/` directory contains:
- `content.md` — verbatim tweet text, author info (bio, followers, verified), image references
- `metadata.json` — raw gallery-dl dump
- Image files (if any)

Threads are stitched into a single `content.md` in chronological order. Brady's optional note appears as a blockquote at the top.

**Cookie refresh:** When cookies expire, `!tweet refresh` will report it. Fix: log into Twitter in Chrome on Mac Mini, cookies refresh automatically.

**Review flow:** During Mayor sessions, Brady says "let's go through the inbox." Mayor reads each `content.md` via GitHub API. Brady decides action. After review, `!inbox clear` moves all to archive.

**Repo size management:** Images are committed to vault-context (active inbox has full media). Run `!tweet cleanup` periodically to strip images from archive entries older than 30 days. Text and metadata are kept permanently.

---

## Tweet Research Agent

**Added:** 2026-03-12 (PLAN-014)

Background agent that transforms raw tweet captures into structured research briefs. Runs every 5 minutes as a launchd service, processes one tweet per pass by default.

| Component | Path | Role |
|-----------|------|------|
| Research agent | `~/foreman-bot/tweet-researcher.js` | Main entry point — scans inbox, calls claude -p, writes research.md |
| URL resolver | `~/foreman-bot/url-resolver.js` | Fetches and extracts text from linked GitHub READMEs, blog posts, articles |
| launchd plist | `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.foreman.tweet-researcher.plist` | Runs agent every 300 seconds |
| Log | `~/.local/log/tweet-researcher.log` | Rotates automatically at 10 MB |

**Pipeline:**
```
content.md (status: pending)
  → url-resolver.js (fetches GitHub READMEs, blog posts, articles)
  → claude -p sonnet (generates structured research brief)
  → research.md (written to TWEET-{id}/ directory)
  → content.md status: researched
  → git commit + push
```

**Foreman commands:**

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `!research` | Show queue status (pending / researched / failed counts) |
| `!research run` | Trigger an immediate research pass |
| `!research <tweet-id>` | Force re-research a specific tweet |

**research.md format:** frontmatter with `researched`, `category`, `signal` (high/medium/low), `actionable`; sections for Substance, Linked Content, Relevance, Verdict.

**Image descriptions:** Supported via `--with-images` flag (opt-in). Spawns a separate `claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions` call per image; claude reads the image file and returns a description. Not run by default due to added latency. Mayor can always view images directly via the tweet URL.

**To manage:**
```bash
launchctl list com.foreman.tweet-researcher    # check status
launchctl stop com.foreman.tweet-researcher    # stop
launchctl start com.foreman.tweet-researcher   # start
tail -f ~/.local/log/tweet-researcher.log      # live log
node ~/foreman-bot/tweet-researcher.js --batch 5   # manual backlog clear
node ~/foreman-bot/tweet-researcher.js --with-images  # with image descriptions
```

---

## Tweet Library

**Added:** 2026-03-15 (WO-058)

Researched tweets are organized into a permanent library at `vault-context/library/tweets/`. After Mayor reviews and decides to keep a tweet, it moves from inbox to library.

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `vault-context/library/tweets/` | Permanent library root — `YYYY-MM-DD-slug/` directories |
| `vault-context/inbox/tweets/` | Active pending entries awaiting review |

Each library entry: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug/` with `content.md`, `research.md`, and any images.

**Foreman command:** `!library [<page>]` — browse library entries paginated (10 per page).

---

## Tweet Synthesis Engine

**Added:** 2026-03-16 (PLAN-016)

On-demand synthesis that reads across the tweet library, clusters themes, cross-references against active projects and system state, and produces actionable WO sketch proposals. Triggered via `!synthesize` in Discord.

| Component | Path | Role |
|-----------|------|------|
| Synthesizer script | `~/foreman-bot/tweet-synthesizer.js` | Reads library, builds context, calls Opus, writes output |
| State file | `~/.local/state/synthesis-last-run.json` | Tracks last run date and processed tweet slugs for incremental mode |
| Output directory | `~/Documents/vault-context/library/synthesis/` | Dated synthesis files (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`) |

**Foreman commands:**

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `!synthesize` | Run incremental synthesis (new tweets since last run only) |
| `!synthesize full` | Run full library synthesis (all 60+ tweets) |
| `!synthesize last` | Show most recent synthesis summary without re-running |

**Pipeline:**
```
library/tweets/*/research.md
  → tweet-synthesizer.js reads frontmatter + substance summaries
  → loads PROJECTS.md + STATE.md + RECENT_CHANGES.md + CLAUDE-LEARNINGS.md
  → claude -p opus (clusters themes, cross-refs projects, proposes WO sketches)
  → library/synthesis/YYYY-MM-DD.md (written + committed to vault-context)
  → Discord summary embed (theme clusters + top proposals)
```

**Output format:** Themed clusters with tweet counts, project cross-references, and WO sketch proposals each rated by impact (high/medium/low) and effort (small/medium/large).

**Model:** Opus (`claude -p opus`). High-value, low-frequency — cost is acceptable. Falls back to Sonnet if Opus is rate-limited (noted in output).

**Incremental mode:** Default. Reads only tweets researched after the last synthesis run. First run is always full. Use `--full` flag to re-read everything.

**Guard:** Synthesis is blocked while worker is active (`worker_status: processing` in STATE.md) to prevent git conflicts.

**To manage:**
```bash
node ~/foreman-bot/tweet-synthesizer.js            # incremental run
node ~/foreman-bot/tweet-synthesizer.js --full     # full run
cat ~/.local/state/synthesis-last-run.json         # check last run state
ls ~/Documents/vault-context/library/synthesis/    # list output files
```

## Matrix Homeserver

**Added:** 2026-03-15 (WO-059)

Self-hosted Matrix homeserver running on Mac Mini via Docker Compose.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Matrix URL | `https://plvr.net` |
| Element Web | `https://chat.plvr.net` |
| Stack location | `~/matrix-server/` |
| Data | `~/matrix-server/data/tuwunel/` (RocksDB — back this up) |
| Admin user | `@arc:plvr.net` |
| Signing key | `~/matrix-server/data/tuwunel/` (generated on first run) |

**Services (Docker Compose):**

| Container | Image | Port |
|-----------|-------|------|
| `matrix-server-tuwunel-1` | `jevolk/tuwunel:latest` | `127.0.0.1:8008` |
| `matrix-server-element-web-1` | `vectorim/element-web:latest` | `127.0.0.1:80` |

**Architecture:** Tuwunel and Element Web run in Docker (Colima) with `restart: unless-stopped`. cloudflared runs natively on Mac as a launchd agent (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/net.cloudflare.cloudflared.plist`) to avoid QUIC/UDP issues inside Colima VM.

**Docker runtime:** Colima (`colima start/stop`). If Colima fails to start with "disk in use" error, remove stale lock: `rm ~/.colima/_lima/_disks/colima/in_use_by`. Note: use `docker-compose` (not `docker compose`) — the Compose plugin is not wired into Colima's Docker.

**cloudflared launchd service:**
```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/net.cloudflare.cloudflared.plist   # start
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/net.cloudflare.cloudflared.plist # stop
cat /tmp/cloudflared.stderr.log   # logs
```
Token lives directly in the plist `ProgramArguments` `--token` arg. If tunnel fails with "Invalid tunnel secret", regenerate the token in Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard (Zero Trust → Networks → Tunnels → plvr.net), then update the plist and unload/reload: `launchctl unload` + update plist + `launchctl load`.

**To manage Docker stack:**
```bash
cd ~/matrix-server
docker-compose up -d          # start
docker-compose down           # stop
docker-compose ps             # check status
docker-compose logs -f        # live logs
```

**Current status (2026-03-17, WO-065 complete):** All services running and healthy. Tunnel reconnected with refreshed token. All 4 cloudflared connections registered (atl11/atl12/atl14). `plvr.net/_matrix/client/versions` → 200, `chat.plvr.net` → 200, federation `/version` verified. Auto-recovery: Docker services have `restart: unless-stopped`; cloudflared has `KeepAlive: true` in launchd plist.
